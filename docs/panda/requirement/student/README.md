# Studentsâ€™ Study Schedules
The study schedules inform students of which room a subject uses. Based on this in-formation, each space schedule can be constructed.

Every faculty opens these schedules to the public where they are accessible from KMITL website. As a lecturer, this is the only on-line way to view room availability.

The schedule is complex, and students cannot create their own timetables easily. They need to use Microsoft Excel or online calendar services to help them make their own timetables. Yet, they still have to do it manually.
