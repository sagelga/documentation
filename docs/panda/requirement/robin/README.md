# Robin Room Reservation System
Robin is an enterprise-grade space reservation service. It has the same reservation pro-cedures as our upcoming service, as it lets users search for an available space and re-serve it. Their constraints exclude the approver mechanics, but other parts are quite the same.

Robin is a subscription service priced at $5 per month per user, which may rack up to a whopping $100,000 annually.

The service also includes APIâ€™s that allow Internet of Thing devices to display current room usage and upcoming reservations. It is advertised to work on any screen size and even e-ink screens.

Robin has an easy-to-use user interface. A user can click on a space to see more infor-mation about the space or click on a timeframe to reserve it right away.
