# Administration and Management College (AMC)
## Overview
Normally, this college/faculty has a very few classrooms, so their schedule is quite re-used and not much run into trouble of needing a room. In need of more rooms, they will use a room in Princess Sirindhorn’s General Instruction Building.

Based on their request form, they have the same procedures and form requirements as other faculties. This means other faculties’ forms or written-type form can be used with AMC seamlessly.

They also have a room usage schedule in front of every room that can be reserved. We have seen this format of schedule at Princess Sirindhorn’s General Instruction Building Educational Support, which was exported and printed from Office of Regis-trar website.

## The Request Form
The request form requires:
-	a requester’s name, major, year
-	a space name
-	required seats
-	a reservation purpose
-	a duration
-	additional equipment
