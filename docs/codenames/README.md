# Codenames

Codenames word list repository.

Codenames is a spy-guessing game for 2 and more players, created by Vlaada Chv√°til and published by Czech Games Edition. This repository is created to store all of the words that are in the board game (and custom too!) words for your recreational and non-commercial use.
