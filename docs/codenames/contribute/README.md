## Branch Naming Convention
After you have forked this repo (or directly commit to this repo), create a new branch that matches our branch name convention.

You shall use one of these prefix to name your branch.
- `typos/<language-ISO-code>/<word-pack-name>` for word typos-related Pull Request.
- `content/<language-ISO-code>/<word-pack-name>` for adding more words to the repo.
- `feature/<issue-number>/<feature-name>` for adding Python scripts.
- `patch/<issue-number>/<feature-name>` for patching Python script and tweaking.
- `chore/` for editing any docs-based files (e.g. this CONTRIBUTING.md file)

For example, if you want to add wordlist for Adults, create your branch as `content/en-en/adults` and start adding contents!

For `<language-ISO-code>`, follow [ISO-standard language code (ISO 639-1:2002)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (e.g. `en-EN` for Standard English, `zh-hk` for Hongkong Chinese)

For `<word-pack-name>`, use [lowercase-kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) (e.g. `duos-nsfw`)

If you have any questions, feel free to create a new issue and reference this heading.

## Add new content
To start adding wordlist, create these files under `wordlist/<language-ISO-code>/<word-pack-name>` :
- `wordlist.txt` for [word list](#word-list).
- `README.md` for [credit source and word list description](#credit-source).

### Word list
For a new wordlist, add your word in the `wordlist.txt` **as line separated**.<br/>Word list that is not line separated will be automatically closed.

And each word must follow this guideline:
- No typos are allowed.
- Encode file using an appropriate file encoding (e.g. UTF-8).

and this covention:
- Each word **is a word. Not a sentence.**
- Must contains **only one ISO language code**.
- Wordlist **does not contain duplicate** based on each language's [duplication guidelines](./duplicate/).
- Check that your wordlist is **not a duplicate to *pending wordlist Pull Request* or *existing wordlist*.**
- Same word that can be exchangable is considered duplicates.

This convention list is born-to-be exploited. If you feel like your word list should not follow this convention or feel like this convention is a flaw, feel free to reply and explains why you think it shouldn't follow the convention.

### Credit Source
For contents that you scrapped from any source, you must add the source that you brought from in `README.md`.

In that file, add a URL and/or description on where you scrapped these words from.
Add any description you feel like to.
