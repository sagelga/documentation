# About
Welcome to the documentation for this website, 'docs.sagelga.com', where we stores Documentation for other cool project that I've made. Kinda trippy isn't it?

Anyways, like the [license](https://github.com/sagelga/documentation/blob/main/.github/LICENSE) says, you can do anything you like to with this documentation (this is not a legal advice), so anyone with brillant ideas can help and improve (or mess it all up) this project as you like. No rush.

I will try to document anything as we keep improving this Documentation website.

This site is powered by Vuepress, built with Vue.
