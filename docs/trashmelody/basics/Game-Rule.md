# How to play
There's 4 types of bin: dangerous, recycle, wet, and general. And 12 trashes which must be placed to the specific bin. When the game started, trashes will pop up on the screen one at a time. When the scan line pass a trash, the player needs to type a character on a keyboard to put a trash to the right bin: dangerous(D), recycle(F), wet(J), general(K).
