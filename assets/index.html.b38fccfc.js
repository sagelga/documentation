This may create a lot of difficulties to space requesters. So, administrators need some helper methods to process all the many requests. For example, writing it down on a big whiteboard; filling it into the Outlook service and many other methods.</p><h2 id="workflow-of-the-current-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#workflow-of-the-current-system" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Workflow of the Current System</h2><h3 id="step-1-ask-an-administrator-about-a-space-s-availability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-1-ask-an-administrator-about-a-space-s-availability" aria-hidden="true">#</a> STEP 1: ASK AN ADMINISTRATOR ABOUT A SPACE\u2019S AVAILABILITY</h3><p>A requester needs to ask a relevant administrator about his desired space\u2019s availabil-ity and gives his requirements to the administrator to choose a space that is right for the requester.
