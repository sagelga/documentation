They deal with requesters directly and contact the teams in each building about the requesters\u2019 requirements. They manage:</p><ol><li>5,000-Seat Convention Hall</li><li>Faculty of Engineering\u2019s Auditorium</li><li>KMITL\u2019s sports facilities</li><li>KMITL\u2019s dormitory</li><li>Innovation building</li><li>The areas around the Office of President</li></ol><p>Reservation of the Convention Hall and the Auditorium requires a small fee for stu-dents and lecturers for educational uses. For external sources or profit-based events, there is another rate of charge. The division tries to bring in companies that want to use its facilities and collects them with a charge, so it deals with external sources directly. The companies, the lecturers and the students wanting to make a reservation must write a formal agreement and send it directly to the division. The division will try to manage and find a schedule that matches their requirements. Then, the requester must make an upfront payment for the reservation. These procedures can take weeks to process, so most instantaneous requests are much likely to be rejected.</p><p>The division told us that they had no service to show the schedules to external sources. Requesters who want to make a reservation must call them first to check the schedules. They are still finding a way to let requesters view the schedules by themselves. They are currently using Google Calendar to manage reservations.</p><p>Another issue in their workflow is an additional requirement. Some requesters want a maid and a guard, so the division must collaborate with those staff for an overtime agreement and payment. In this type of requests, the requester must make a reserva-tion in advance of weeks prior to the reserved date and must detail it in the agreement.</p><h2 id="_5-000-seat-convention-hall-form-analysis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-000-seat-convention-hall-form-analysis" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 5,000-Seat Convention Hall Form Analysis</h2><p>To reserve the Convention Hall, the form requires basic information such as</p><ul><li>a requester\u2019s name</li><li>a requester\u2019s information</li><li>a reservation purpose</li><li>number of attendees</li><li>additional equipment</li><li>additional staff</li></ul><p>With an additional question for</p><ul><li>additional security guards and audio technicians</li><li>tables, chairs</li><li>an additional reception room</li></ul><p>As the request is counted as non-educational or/and overtime, one who wish to use the convention hall, they might need to pay for additional cost for hiring a security guards and maid, as they will take it as overtime work.</p>',13),r=[n];function o(l,d){return t(),i("div",null,r)}var u=e(s,[["render",o],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
