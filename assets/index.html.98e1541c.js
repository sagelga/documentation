The room manager then needs to look up through calendars, spreadsheets, or even papers (depending on each manager) to make sure the room hasn\u2019t already been reserved at a certain time. If the room is available, then the requester receives a reservation form and fills it up. The form needs physical signatures from various persons, e.g. teachers, staff, and authorities, before being returned to the room manager which will register the reservation on their records to finish the process.</p><p>The Online Room Reservation System is the system to improve this workflow by allowing the whole process to be done online. This means any student, teacher, and staff in the institute can reserve a room at any time and from any place they\u2019re comfortable with. Just log in with an existing organization account, search for a room, select an available time, then submit a request and wait for an approval.</p><h2 id="functionalities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#functionalities" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Functionalities</h2><ol><li>Students, teachers, and staff in the institute can request spaces online.</li><li>Users can check space availabilities and present a reservation proof to relevant authorities.</li><li>Users can scan a QR code in front of a room to view its information and interact with the system.</li><li>Users can make a recurring reservation.</li><li>Users can edit or cancel their requests right away, and authorities will be notified.</li><li>The system can notify authorities and staff to approve or deny room requests.</li><li>The system is easy to use and supports mobile devices.</li><li>The system supports role and permission management to suit the variable requirements of each faculty.</li></ol><h2 id="business-values" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#business-values" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Business Values</h2><h3 id="tangible" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tangible" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tangible</h3><ul><li>Reduces the use of paper and printer ink</li><li>Speeds up request time and simplifies the request process</li></ul><h3 id="intangible" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#intangible" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Intangible</h3><ul><li>Creates user satisfaction.</li><li>Reduces human errors from the staff and the users.</li><li>Minimizes overlapping requests created by redundant information</li></ul><h2 id="special-constraints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#special-constraints" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Special constraints</h2><p>The user needs to be connected to the Internet</p>',14),n=[r];function o(l,h){return a(),i("div",null,n)}var d=e(s,[["render",o],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{d as default};
