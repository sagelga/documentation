# sagelga's Documentation
Documentation for everything repository

This repository houses all the documentation and related information for various projects developed by Sagelga. Our documentation website is designed to provide you with in-depth insights, guides, and resources for each of our projects. 

You can explore our documentation by visiting [docs.sagelga.com](https://docs.sagelga.com).

## About

Our documentation website has undergone a transition in terms of technology stack. Previously, we utilized VuePress and GitHub Actions for maintaining the site. However, we have now migrated to Netlify and Docusaurus to enhance the user experience and streamline our documentation process.

## Installation (For Development)
