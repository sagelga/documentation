# documentation
Documentation for everything repository

## Origins
This repository is built for documentation storage; on GitHub; powered by Vuepress.<br/>
Merging all of the documentations that are scattered around my repository is not good thing to do.<br>'
So I decided to make this repository contains every documentation that I have + everything is being automatically managed and remains future-proof.

## Service use
I am currently using
- Dependabot
    - To manage a Vuepress-based dependencies and allows Dependabot to update when needed.
- GitHub Actions
    - Allows the website to be automatically built. No more manual build-and-commit anymore.

and probably more. Very soon.
